This application helps the user keep track of how much dinner money they need to pay this month.
School holidays, INSET days and the variance in the number of school days in different months mean that each
month parents have to manually count the days in the month that they have to pay for dinners for, and calculate
how much money to add.

This is quite a trivial problem as you can always overpay, however it is quite satisfying to know how far ahead you are with
payments!
